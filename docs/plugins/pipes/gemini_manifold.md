## Installation

To install this plugin, navigate to the [Open WebUI Community page for Gemini Manifold](https://openwebui.com/f/suurt8ll/gemini_manifold_google_genai) and click the white "Get" button.

## Configuration

After installation, click the gear icon next to the `gemini_manifold_google_genai` function within Open WebUI. At a minimum, you must enter your Google Gemini API key. Other configurable options are also available on that settings page.

## Usage

If the whitelist and blacklist are configured to allow models, those models will appear in the Open WebUI model selection list. If valid credentials for both Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI are provided then the models get fetched from both sources and merged together. To use a Gemini model, simply select it from the list and begin your chat.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the Open WebUI logs for error messages. The logs contain detailed information that should help pinpoint the problem. If you need further assistance, please open a new issue in this repository.
